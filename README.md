# Experimenting with microfrontends

## Features:

- All the nextjs goodies (ssr, edge, routing, react server components, free improvements)
- posibility to run non react microfrontends (e.g. svelte, vue, vanilla js)

## Getting started

```
nvm use
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm dev-proxy
go to localhost:3000 for nextjs or localhost:3000/about for nuxt
```

## Good starting point

`apps/nextjs/pages/index.tsx`
