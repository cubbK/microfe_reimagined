# Microfontends Reinvented - Using Next.js as a base

Features:

- All the nextjs goodies (ssr, edge, routing, react server components, free improvements)
- posibility to run non react microfrontends (e.g. svelte, vue, vanilla js)

## Getting started

```
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Good starting point

`apps/main/pages/index.tsx`
